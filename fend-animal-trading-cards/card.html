			<!-- your favorite animal's description goes here -->
			<p>With their light body weight and blunt claws, cheetahs are not well designed to protect themselves or their prey. When a larger or more aggressive animal approaches a cheetah in the wild, it will give up its catch to avoid a fight. A cheetah has amazing eyesight during the day and can spot prey from 5km away.</p>
